# Creating Platfrom Service

Note: The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
